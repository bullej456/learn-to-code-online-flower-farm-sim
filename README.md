# learn-to-code-online-flower-farm-sim
Angular website that utilises user input in the form of code to play a flower farm simulation game. It provides objects and methods for a user to utilise in the input box. Things like for loops would help the user better automate the process and hence reinforce less simplisitic programming solutions.

Currently it is in a prototype state.

In the current state it needs to be expanded by adding notifications which unlock content as the user goes through the game. It also needs more objects and types of plants to create variety in the outcome of user actions. Logging in of accounts to preserve data states would also be good (or at the very least some kind of seed creation).

Other future additions might include animations and sound effects for a greater emotional experience.
